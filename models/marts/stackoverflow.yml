macros:

  - name: get_opportunity_tags
    description: Extracts a list of tags that are considered to be an opportunity for developers to answer or a risk of churn of users. Gets the 'n_tags' lowest ratio answers-questions tags over 'n_answers' answers, and reduces the tags to those with a number of answers in the range 'l_limit' and 'r_limit'.
    arguments:
    
      - name: n_answers
        type: integer
        description: There must be more than this number of answers to consider a tag relevant.
      - name: n_tags
        type: integer
        description: The number of tags with the lowest answers-questions ratio (answers/questions).
      - name: l_limit
        type: integer
        description: Out of the n_tags gathered, defines the range left limit of the number of answers to select the final tags.
      - name: r_limit
        type: integer
        description: Out of the n_tags gathered, defines the range right limit of the number of answers to select the final tags.


  - name: not_less_than_zero

analyses:

  - name: popular_topics_pct_of_answers
    description: Calculates the % of answers for each tag within the group of tags gathered by the macro 'get_opportunity_tags'. Helps understand, combined with the answers-questions ratio, which of those tags may be worth putting more effort on. [ There is a page in a report on Looker Studio with this analysis ]
