# ra-stackoverflow-trial

This repo contains a full **dbt** project that is part of an analytics engineer trial example that can be found [here](https://github.com/rittmananalytics/analytics_engineer_trial).

It has been done solely for (auto)training purposes on the tool following the [development standards](https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/best-practices/how-we-structure/1-guide-overview) suggested by **dbt**.

There is also a public dataset in BigQuery ( *id = earnest-cosmos-375111.dbt_stackoverflow* ) that includes a DWH model populated with the data transformed using **dbt**.
